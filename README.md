# CHAOSS-GSoC-2020: Implementing GitLab worker & binding the GitLab API, Github API & Augur schema
Repository for Augur Microtasks. It contains a brief information about my background and experiences in the field of Data Engineering and worker development along with the list of Microtasks completed.

## About Me
I am an amateur Founder skilled at Data Engineering, Android Development & Competitive Programming, currently pursuing Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Dhanbad. Following are my work experiences.
- Data Engineer Intern-19 at **Zendrive**, Bangalore
- Data Engineer Intern-18 at **FedEx Express**, Mumbai
- Big Data Developer Intern-17 at InfoGrains, Indore
- Founder & Full Stack Android Developer at Night Foodler, Dhanbad

## Experience with Data Collector Workers
I have previously developed data collector workers for:
- Jira
- Salesforce
- Elasticsearch 
- Redshift
- Sage Intacct

with an architecture similar to that suggested in my proposal. These workers would run on a daily basis at a specific time and fetch all the data added after the scriptâ€™s previous run and later push it into Google Big Query.
